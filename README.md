🧪 How It Works
User inputs their date of birth

JavaScript calculates Earth age

That age is converted using each planet's orbital ratio:

Mercury: Earth ÷ 0.24

Venus: Earth ÷ 0.62

Mars: Earth ÷ 1.88

Jupiter: Earth ÷ 11.86

Planet elements animate around the center and show age on hover

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for orbit animations and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) for dynamic age calculation


📱 Responsive Design
Optimized for mobile and desktop
